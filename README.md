# iPad Pro Mount

This is meant to hook into a aviation [seat rail](https://www.amazon.ca/Ram-Mount-RAM-B-131-238-AIRCRAFT-SEAT/dp/B008JH19DI) mount.

Most of this is parametrized so if you locate the magnetic spots on an iPad you can drop in your own size.
This was made for a 12.9" 4th gen iPad Pro.
